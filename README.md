Background story :
Bibbly and his bunny friends wish to travel to planet carrotton in hopes of finding a better life, one where the carrots are bountiful. 
Bibbly has to brave the asteroids of the furry-way galaxy to get to his destination. He needs your help to steer the spaceship and get to planet carroton safely.
Everytime Bibbly runs into an asteroid, one of his bunny budddies get injured and will float into endless space, wishing they trusted Bibbly.
